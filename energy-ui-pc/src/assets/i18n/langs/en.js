      p1:"Here are some common Q&A questions. Customer service requires a lot of work and replies may not always be as timely. You can consult customer service after reading the content on this page.",
      p2:"Q: What country numbers are there?",
      p3:"A: Currently, there are only+1 area codes for Canada and the United States. Don't ask if there are any other countries, we only provide this area code. Many projects are actually not as strict as distinguishing the numbers of these two countries, such as",
      p4:"Q: What are the projects?",
      p5:"A: All project lists are updated instantly on sms.code877.com. At present, the platform mainly focuses on foreign projects and also doubles as domestic projects, but it will gradually reduce domestic projects in the future. If you are doing domestic projects, please hurry up, otherwise one day we will suddenly become wealthy and completely lose sight of domestic projects. Additionally, if using domestic project URLs or APIs, we only support USDT.",
      p6:"Q: Is it a virtual card or a physical card?",
      p7:"A: Although claiming to be a physical card is a premium method, we are still honest to tell you that our cards are all virtual cards. If you're an old hand, you know by the price. However, we all issue the first code, so the code reception rate is particularly high. Some apps cannot be accessed due to their own risk control reasons, such as WhatsApp and PayPal. The so-called physical card access codes on the market are all cards that have been used N times and have an absurdly low access rate. If you need that type of card, don't contact us. Although we admit to being a virtual card, we have not written about projects that we clearly cannot accept, such as Facebook, Discord, Line, and so on. We are still very clear about what can be done and what cannot be done, after all, playing small tricks cannot make a lot of money.",
      p8: "Q: How to use your platform?",
      p9:"A: Usage of web front-end:",
      p10:"1. Register an account in the code receiving system and log in to see if there are any projects you need in the project list",
      p11:"2. Click on 'Purchase Card Secret Channel', 10 yuan card secret means you can recharge 10 yuan, and so on",
      p12:"3. After purchasing, you will receive a string of card passwords. In the Recharge section of the receiving system page, enter the card password and the corresponding amount will be displayed in your balance",
      p13:"4. Click on 'Get Number 'in the project you need to enter the verification code acquisition page.",
      p14:"5. Click on 'Get Number' to obtain a North American phone number. Enter the phone number on the app to register. At this time, the phone number will receive a verification code. If it does not appear temporarily, it may be due to a delay in the app server. It will automatically refresh every 5 seconds, and a total of 60 attempts will be made to obtain it.",
      p15:"After successfully registering the app, you can release the number in advance and click on 'Stop receiving code'.",
      p16:"The front is the number, and the area code+1 has been automatically omitted. If you need it, add it yourself. In the middle is the project name Affirm, followed by a link. Open the link in the browser and automatically read the content of the code. Various software suitable for bulk registration of apps. The default link is the domain name with our official website. If you need to resell it, please contact customer service and do not display our website. There is an IP version available, such as http://143.198.141.109/admin/auth/get/token?token=4efad311a49948b9a0ec4740aa5de1b4",
      p17:"If you need to access the code through an API, please refer to the API instructions on the website. API code also accepts automatic recharge from USDT. After directly recharging to a fixed address, the balance is automatically updated, making it convenient for your platform to access.",
      p18:"Q: How long is the validity period of the number?",
      p19: "A: The validity period of the number varies, with varying durations, up to 3 months. If you have high time requirements, such as having to wait for more than 2 months and have to receive the code multiple times, please contact customer service.",
      p20:"Q: Can I repeat the code?",
      p21:"A: Ordinary users cannot repeatedly access the code on the front end of the webpage because there are too many numbers in the system, and the number you obtain each time is not fixed. If you repeatedly receive the code, you need to use a URL to receive the code, which is equivalent to fixing a batch of numbers for you. If you need to repeat the code, contact customer service (starting from 50).",
      p22:"Q: Why use URLs to retrieve codes but not to provide them?",
      p23:"A: If you are doing reverse buying and selling, this problem may occur. There are two reasons. Firstly, your customer's network environment cannot support the website's CDN. We are using CloudFlare's CDN service, which is not supported in some domestic network environments. The second issue is that it is not possible to parse https, so simply switch to the IP version of the URL.",
      p24:"Q: What port are you on?",
      p25:"A: Those who mention this often do not understand the basics of the internet. The IP consists of four segments, and they often refer to the first segment of the IP as the 'port', which is different from the real port. But because there were too many mentions of this, we had no choice but to tell them that we are on port 143. If you have tried other people's 143 port before and think the connection rate is very low, then it doesn't matter if you don't need our service, and we don't serve this type of white person either.",
      p26:"Q: How do I add the project I want?",
      p27:"A: Regular popular projects, many of which do not support virtual card codes, such as Discord, Line, Facebook, Tinder, etc. If you need codes for some unpopular projects, contact customer service and send a successful SMS template to customer service to add projects. The premise is that there must be a quantity. Adding items for one or two of your codes is not cost-effective for us.",
      p28:"Q: Why can't Google, Microsoft, or Apple access the code?",
      p29:"A: These three are all large companies, and each company has a lot of business under it. Each business is actually separate, so some business can be coded, which does not mean that all can be coded. For example, Google Voice and Google Cloud Services are two different businesses. What specific business can these three companies handle? You can consult customer service. You can also test it yourself.",
      p30:"Q: Can I have a refund?",
      p31:"A: No way. The account balance will always be retained, and you can forward the account to others who need it.",
